One drawback of those previous iterators is that we need to create a new closure to initialize each new loop. For most situations, this is not a real problem.For instance, in the allwords iterator, the cost of creating one single closure is negligible compared to the cost of reading a whole Ô¨Åle. However, in some situations this overhead can be inconvenient. In such cases, we can use the generic for itself to keep the iteration state. In this section, we will see the facilities that the generic for offers to hold state.
